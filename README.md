# Face detection with YOLOv5

The provided notebook uses the [WIDER FACE](http://shuoyang1213.me/WIDERFACE/) dataset to train a yolov5s model to detect faces.
The notebook was created in Google Colab and can be accessed [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kQkioaIgxtNrFtT349VLqNhW-wiQxwM1?usp=sharing).
The trained model can be downloaded from Google Drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yHZ05ndv_SPQlDjp79JjOuYSBtcCETEc?usp=share_link).
If you want to use the trained model in Google Colab, you don't need to download it as it is downloaded in the notebook.

Instructions to train and do inference is given in the notebook.
